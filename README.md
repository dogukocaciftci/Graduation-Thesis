# Graduation Thesis: Visualization of Open Bank Transaction Data using Treemaps

## Introduction
In today's data-driven world, effective visualization and interpretation of complex datasets are crucial. Data visualization serves as a powerful tool for gaining insights, identifying patterns, and making informed decisions. This graduation thesis focuses on data visualization in the context of Open Bank Transaction Data. The objective is to employ treemaps, a visually compelling technique, to create informative and analytical representations of financial activities. Through the visualization of five distinct stories derived from the dataset, the thesis aims to shed light on various aspects of financial behaviors and patterns.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this research stems from multiple sources. Firstly, the unwavering trust and guidance of the thesis advisor have encouraged the exploration of this captivating area of study. The fascination with the intricacies of financial transactions and the desire to uncover hidden insights have also propelled the interest in this subject matter. Moreover, there is a personal drive to expand knowledge and skills in the field of data visualization, recognizing its immense potential in enhancing financial literacy, aiding financial planning, and facilitating decision-making processes. By effectively visualizing and analyzing the Open Bank Transaction Data, the research aims to contribute to these domains and empower individuals to make informed financial choices.

## Scope
The research focuses on the accurate and analytical visualization of selected data stories derived from the Open Bank Transaction Data. The exploration revolves around five key narratives: a comparative analysis between BP (Bill Payments) and other transaction types spanning the years 2018-2022, an examination of user transaction activity, an investigation into the relationship between balance fluctuations and transaction types across various locations on a monthly basis, an exploration of major expense categories categorized by transaction types and location, and a comparison between quarantine and non-closed periods from December 1, 2019, to December 31, 2022.

The dataset used in this research is meticulously maintained, offering comprehensive and reliable information. No significant limitations, such as missing or incomplete details, have been encountered during the analysis. The regularity of the data collection process further enhances the robustness and reliability of the findings.

There are no restrictions or specific considerations regarding data visualization techniques and analytical approaches. This flexibility allows the exploration of various visualization methods and the application of advanced analytical techniques to derive meaningful insights from the data. However, careful selection of the subjects to visualize was essential to present informative and impactful narratives that provide a comprehensive understanding of individual financial behaviors and patterns.

## Significance
This research holds great significance in the context of financial literacy and decision-making. The visualization of Open Bank Transaction Data provides a comprehensive overview of financial activities, enabling individuals to assess their financial health, identify trends, and make informed choices. By leveraging the power of treemaps, complex financial information can be presented in a visually appealing and easily interpretable manner, fostering better comprehension and engagement.

Treemaps offer several advantages as a visualization technique. They provide a hierarchical representation of data, allowing users to navigate through different levels of information and gain insights into the relationships between various dimensions. The use of color coding and size proportions in treemaps enables the effective communication of data patterns and distributions. Additionally, treemaps facilitate the comparison of different categories, highlighting variations and anomalies within the dataset. These attributes make treemaps a valuable tool for visualizing and analyzing financial data, enabling users to grasp complex patterns and trends effortlessly.

## Limitations and Considerations
It is important to acknowledge the limitations of this research. The findings and interpretations drawn from the Open Bank Transaction Data are contingent upon the quality and accuracy of the dataset itself. While efforts have been made to ensure data integrity and protection, it is essential to recognize that data collected from various sources may contain inherent biases, errors, or omissions. The generalizability of the findings may also be influenced by the specific characteristics of the dataset used. Therefore, caution should be exercised when extrapolating the results to broader populations or contexts.

Validity and reliability have been paramount considerations throughout the research process. Stringent measures have been implemented, including data cleansing techniques to minimize errors and inconsistencies in the dataset. Robust analytical methods, guided by established statistical principles, have been utilized to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the findings. Additionally, the utilization of treemaps as a visualization technique aligns with established best practices and standards in the field of data visualization.

## Conclusion
This graduation thesis explores and visualizes the Open Bank Transaction Data using treemaps. By providing comprehensive insights into financial activities, patterns, and relationships, this research contributes to the fields of data visualization and financial analysis. The utilization of treemaps as a visualization technique enables individuals to gain a deeper understanding of their financial behaviors, enhancing financial literacy and supporting informed decision-making. Through careful methodology, robust analysis, and thoughtful interpretation, this research strives to unlock the stories hidden within the dataset, empowering individuals to navigate their financial landscapes with confidence and knowledge.
